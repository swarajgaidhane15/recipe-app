- This is a very basic React app that implements `Recipe App`.
- User can search for any specific ingredient in the search bar and hit `Enter`.
- The app will populate all the food products we can make from that ingredient.
- However user will only get the other required ingredients. Remaining procedure needs to be surfed on internet.

#### Steps to follow
Paste following commands in terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/swarajgaidhane15/recipe-app-react
```

```
cd recipe-app-react
```

```
npm install
```

```

Your app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
